<b><i>class</i></b> yappi.<b>YThreadStats</b>

<b>get()</b>
    This method retrieves the current thread stats.      yappi.get_thread_stats() is actually just a wrapper for this function. YThreadStats holds the stat items as a list of _YThreadStat_ object. 

    A _YThreadStat_ object holds the following information:
|| *Key* || *Description* ||
|| id || thread id given by the OS ||
|| name || class name of the current thread object which is derived from threading.Thread class ||
|| ttot || total time spent in the last executed function. See [https://code.google.com/p/yappi/wiki/ClockTypes_v082 Clock Types] to interpret this value correctly. || 
|| sched_count || number of times this thread is scheduled. || 

<b>print_all(out=sys.stdout)</b>
    This method prints the current profile stats to <i>"out"</i> which is  <i>"stdout"</i> by default. 

<b>sort(sort_type, sort_order="desc")</b>
    This method sorts the current profile stats according to the  <i>"sort_type"</i> param. 

    The following are the valid <i>"sort_type"</i> params:
|| *Sort Types* ||
|| name ||
|| id ||  
|| totaltime/ttot || 
|| schedcount/scnt || 

   The following are the valid <i>"sort_order"</i> params:
|| *Sort Orders* ||
|| descending/desc ||
|| ascending/asc || 

<b>clear()</b>
    Clears the retrieved stats. Note that this only clears the current object's stat list. You need to explicitly call _yappi.clear_stats()_ to clear the current profile stats.
    
<b>empty()</b>
    Returns a boolean indicating whether we have any stats available or not.
