[*] TEST: MACOSx and 64 bit needed as we cast long to uintptr_t
[+] TEST: llvm-gcc with WShorten64to32.
[*] Any way to get CPU time with the long known mt problem, where run() is not exiting and ttot stays
    0.000000. -- No way
[+] we have some problems on fnames when yappi test/simple.py is run. string formatting issues again...
[+] We need to have to revisit string formatting functions again. There are a lot of repetitive code.
[+] invalid sort_type for threads.. revisit sort and limit params.
[+] stats.py can generate the sort error write a TC for that.
[+] make full_name like : module:lineno function, maybe use same syntax in callgrind output.
[+] add support for using wall time for profiling. Lots of people download v0.53.
[+] clock type shall be saved in save(), merging two different profile results with different clock types is
    ambigous, prevent that.
[-] maybe add a pause/resume functionality for _yappi. When wee retrieve the stats and the profiler is on user is
    shown the internal functions used by yappi. These should be discarded?
[-] Test debug build after merging the wackou branch.
[-] add saving as pstat format.
[-] add stat tests and re-TEST again. add pstat tests.
[-] stat[4] = 2 will not set the relevant attr. stat.ttot calls the __setitem__ however, stat[4] = 2 does not update stat.ttot
