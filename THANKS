Thanks all the great community of Python, especially the 
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python group for answering my 
silly questions.

Thanks to Dave Peticolas for his formatting patch code/suggestions.

Special thanks to the authors of cProfile module Brett Rosen and Ted Czotter. 
Some parts/ideas of yappi are taken from the source code of cProfile.
